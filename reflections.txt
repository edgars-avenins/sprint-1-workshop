Faster once you get the hang of it. But takes time to get used to as instead of usual GUI you have text and commands.
- just because something looks nicer doesnt mean it's the most effective way to do it.

Hard to stick to them while aiming for results you expect from yourself. I might try to play around less and stay on the path
as playing around caused problems and these problems took a bit longer then expected to deal with

Started out with- git clone "URL" - get the remote repo locally
touch "filename.type" - create a file
start "filename.type" (TAB for quick finish ofcourse)
git add -A   - add all changes
git commit -m "message"  - prepare these changes
git push  - send them to remote repo

git checkout -b "branch name" is same as
git branch "branch name"
git checkout "branch name"

I learned that there are a lot of hidden shortcuts through flags -"x"

git is a tool and github is a service, they dont neceserely mean that you have to use them togehter but its a popular combination

bus card - snapper and snapper reader. You can use your snapper on more than just buses and same goes for bus readers - they dont just read snapper cards

I might remembmer most of the core things as there were few I had to really wrap my mind around, I find that these stick with me better

This time I think I managed to stick to time constraints pretty well, mainly because I skimmed over information that I was familiar with and concentrated on topics that required more information.
